# 100 Days Of Code - Log Book

### Day 1: July 25, 2022 


**Today's Progress**:  

Today is the first day of my #100DaysOfCode Challenge that I came across recently while scrolling through blogs and found this awesome website: https://lnkd.in/d4kNPnsn and I've decided to begin with #webdevelopment and #programming in #Java parallelly followed by #DSA to nurture my #tech_stack.

Majorly I focused on building blocks and basic terminologies which could be categorized in two pointers:

- How does the Internet actually work?
- How actually the website works and what #html, #css, and #javascript exactly do?

Moreover, in Java I learned the functioning of JVM, JRE, and what goes behind the scenes of the execution of a programming language mainly Java.


**Thoughts:**

I feel very delighted to kickstart this journey and would be following the content laid out by Angela Yu (Web Development Bootcamp) and Java & DSA by Kunal Kushwaha. Loved the way they explain and simplify the concepts for a better #visualization.

I look forward to completing this #challenge with full dedication and learning while #networking with my peer hustlers.

Here's a detailed #blog: https://lnkd.in/dk4zHKqK I've written around the same, kindly have a look and would appreciate any #feedback for my betterment.


### Day 2: July 26, 2022 


**Today's Progress**:  

I started with web development and understood the basics of HTML. Since it is the most important component and the skeleton of any website, a detailed introduction is absolutely necessary for optimal usage while structuring the webpage as per our requirements. I also learn about the structure of HTML tags, which I am using to build my personal website project.

Moreover, I explored the various forms of data types, types of languages, classes, objects and custom data types, static and dynamic language, and flowcharts /pseudocode around the Java programming roadmap.


**Thoughts:**

Today is the second day of my #100daysofcode challenge. As I mentioned in my previous post, I wrote a blog (https://lnkd.in/dk4zHKqK) about how and why I started this challenge and posted a blog as well on Medium. Sharing with you my learning of the day. I am delighted to move a step further today, 2% closer to my journey!

### Day 3: July 27, 2022 


**Today's Progress**:  

Well beginning with web development I learned html boilerplate, html lists, image elements, links and anchor tag.

Moreover, in java I got to know about input/output, debugging, what are packages, primitives, printstream, type conversion and type casting, explicit typecasting in expression, automatic type promotion in expression and Unicode principle.


**Thoughts:**

Today is the third day of my #100daysofcodechallenge and once again I am right here to inform you about my progress.
So, without any further delay, I am going to share my today’s learning with you all.
All this has brought me a step closer to my learning and I m pretty glad by exploring a little more, 3% closer to my journey!

### Day 4: July 28, 2022 


**Today's Progress**:  

As a web developer, I gained knowledge of HTML tables, table layouts, and forms.

Additionally, I am providing a code sample from my personal website that shows how I used headings, picture components, anchor tags, tables, and forms.

In Java, I learnt about the three different types of loops (for loop, while loop, and do-while loop), their syntax, and how to write pseudocode and implement them. I also learned about conditional expressions (if-else and nested if-else). I've included a snippet of the program's code below (calculator program).


**Thoughts:**

I'm here here with you all on day four of my 100 Days of Code challenge to discuss what I learnt today and how I've finished 4% of my consistent journey.

### Day 5: July 29, 2022 


**Today's Progress**:

I'll start posting bits of my coding experience on my GitHub page every day as of right now.

I'm also including code snippets that show how to use switch case and nested switch case conditional statement in Java programming. 
Specifically, the type of fruit, the days of the week and employee information.


**Thoughts:**

On day five of my #100daysofcodechallenge, I'm here with you to talk about what I learned today and how I've completed 5% of my consistent journey.

### Day 6: July 30, 2022 


**Today's Progress**:  

Just like the pair of Tom and Jerry, heads and tails such is the complimentary partner of HTML is CSS and hence to make my code lively and add to its visual significance, I began with the CSS, familiarized with inline, internal and external CSS and also learned how to debug CSS code. I’ve also attached a snipped that shows how to change the background colour and modifying the border and appearance of horizontal rule using CSS.  

While programming I came across Functions/Methods in java, method, block and loop scope and shadowing. I’ve also included the code snippet that points to the shadowing program. This 100daysofcodechallenge motivates me daily to learn something new and take me one step further in my journey!



**Thoughts**:

Each day is a new beginning and an opportunity to learn something new. With this thought, I completed the sixth day of my #100daysofcode challenge and I am here to share my learning with you all.

### Day 7: July 31, 2022 


**Today's Progress**:

In Java programming, I've learnt about variable length argument and function overloading also wrote code for Armstrong number, prime/not prime and all 3 digit Armstrong numbers and sharing the code snippets for these as well.


**Thoughts**:

Everyday there must be something to explore anything of your interest and learning from it is a way to enhance your productivity. By Exploring a few things about web development and programming, today I have completed a week of #100daysofcode challenge.
